# Ogcserver

## Python WMS implementation using Mapnik.

    This is the new location for code that was formerly
    embedded in the Mapnik python bindings.
    
    This is now a standalone module:
    
        >>> import ogcserver

    Our hope is that having the server as a standalone
    module will encourage wider development.
